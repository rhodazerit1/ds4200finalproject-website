    <h1> Analyzing Crime in Boston: Looking for Housing </h1>

    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> Researching crime rates in Boston is essential for assessing the safety of various neighborhoods 
        when making a choice on where to live. These crime statistics reveal not only the frequency crime,
        but also the types of crimes prevalent in different areas, serving as key indicators of 
        neighborhood safety and stability.</p>
        
        <p>Crime rates are related to important aspects such as housing quality, community investment, and police 
        effectiveness. High crime rates, especially violent crimes such as assault or robbery, may deter 
        residential and business investments, leading to a decline in neighborhood desirability. On the other 
        hand, areas characterized by low crime rates or predominance of less severe crimes like petty theft 
        are typically more attractive for living, contributing to improved community confidence and growth.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, the impact of specific crimes on safety and lifestyle can vary significantly. For 
        instance, a high incidence of violent crime might be a primary concern for families with children, 
        whereas areas with elevated rates of property crime might raise alarms for homeowners and businesses.</p>
        
        
        <p>To learn more about crime in Boston and its implications for housing selection, consider visiting 
        law enforcement websites or exploring analysis reports from reputable research organizations such as 
        the <a href="https://data.boston.gov/group/public-safety">Data From Boston Police Departments</a> or 
        the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/police">City of Boston's Official Website</a>. 
        
    <h3>Data Introduction</h3>

    <p> Our analysis is centered on data obtained from the Boston Police Department, with a specific focus 
        on crime incidents from the year 2023. To provide valuable insights pertinent to personal and home safety 
        for those seeking housing, we have refined our scope to the top 14 types of crimes. These categories were 
        selected based on their relevance to personal and home safety and include things like murder, assult, and theft.
        Our goal is to assist individuals in making informed decisions about housing by 
        providing a detailed overview of the most pertinent criminal activities.</p>

        <p>Our first visualization presents an interactive map that plots crime 
            occurrences across Boston Police Districts, using Folium to bring geospatial data 
            to life. It offers a comprehensive view, with each crime type distinguished by color
             for clarity. The mapâ€™s interactivity empowers users to filter and focus on crimes of
              particular interest, providing a user-driven exploration of crime distribution by 
              neighborhood. This visualization effectively sets the stage for anyone considering 
              a move to Boston, granting insights into safety across the city and helping identify 
              patterns of criminal activity essential for making informed housing decisions.

            <p>Users can also click on individual crime points to learn more about each specific incident.
                Overall, this graph is definitely very helpful, but we also wanted a simpler version that 
                could be easily understood, which led us to our second graph: A Static Heatmap Breaking 
                Down the Number of Crime Incidents Based on District (directly below). This graph was 
                designed to be very simple and easy to navigate for the average person. From this
                graph we can gather places like Roxbury and South End have the most crime instances, while
                Charlestown and East Boston have the least.   
            </p>

        <h3>Overview of the Crime Distribution: Crime Heatmap </h3>

                <p> 
                    Our third visual is a bar chart showing the amount of each crime 
                    in 2023. The y-axis lists types of crimes, such as assault 
                    (both aggravated and simple), vandalism, and auto theft, among 
                    others, with the counts displayed along the x-axis. Assault appears
                     to be the most frequent, with over 4000 incidents, whereas arson 
                    and murder, non-negligent manslaughter are the least frequent, each 
                    with fewer than 500 incidents. This straightforward representation 
                    allows visitors to quickly discern the relative frequency of different
                    crimes in Boston, offering an informative snapshot for individuals 
                    concerned about local safety, which is particularly useful 
                    for those considering moving to or within the city. 
                </p>
            </div>            
        </div>
        
        <h3> Shootings Based on District</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Our fourth visual is a bar chart that presents a detailed breakdown 
                    of shooting incidents within Boston's various districts for the year 
                    2023. Displayed via horizontal bars, the districts are ranked by the 
                    frequency of shootings, with the x-axis quantifying the incidents. 
                    The chart starkly highlights Roxbury (over 46 shootings) and Mattapan 
                    (around 34 shootings) as the areas with the highest incidences. 
                    These two districts are followed by districts with progressively fewer 
                    events, establishing a clear visual hierarchy of gun violence severity. 
                    The districts with the least amount of shootings are West Roxbury and
                    Charlestown.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The specificity of focusing on shootings is because gun violence is a 
                    primary safety concern when deciding on a place of residence. Shootings 
                    are often a bellwether for broader safety issues and can 
                    disproportionately affect the perception of a neighborhood's security. 
                    However, this graph does present limitations; it isolates shootings from 
                    the context of overall crime. While it is a pivotal piece of the puzzle, 
                    it's essential for viewers to integrate this data with other crime 
                    statistics and visualizations provided to form a comprehensive view of 
                    public safety. A holistic approach to interpreting these visualizations 
                    is crucial.

            </div>   
        </div>

        <p>Our fifth visual is a line graph showcasing trends of crime in boston.This line 
            graph offers an interactive way to view crime trends in Boston over three years 
            2020-2023. Users can select specific crimes to analyze patterns. This is 
            something law enforcement can use to assess their response to crime. Furthermore,
             for our main goal of helping people look for housing, this could help potential
              residents gauge neighborhood safety. The data reveals no overall trend of 
              increase or decrease but shows seasonal peaks, particularly in summer for 
              crimes like assault and auto theft, while other crimes like robbery and 
              burglary remain relatively constant. Notably, auto thefts register the highest 
              frequency, highlighting it as a key concern for city safety and for individuals 
              considering moving to Boston.

        <h3>Incident Count Per Districts</h3>

        <p>
            The final visual is a bar chart titled "Count Plot of the Frequency of Crime in 
            Each Boston District''. It presents a clear and interactive visualization using 
            D3.js, allowing users to select and view crime incident counts for specific 
            districts in Boston. The y-axis lists the districts, while the x-axis represents 
            the number of reported incidents. 
            Roxbury stands out with the highest count, 
            depicted in red, indicating a significant volume of crime in comparison to other 
            districts.Meanwhile, Charlestown and East Boston  stood out in having the least 
            amount of crime incidents. This interactive feature of selecting districts enables
             users, especially those considering relocation, to closely examine the crime 
             statistics of each area, offering a valuable perspective on safety and helping 
             inform their decision-making regarding neighborhood choices.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
            When interpreting our data, it's crucial to recognize the context behind the numbers. 
            Some areas, particularly residential neighborhoods, may show higher rates of certain 
            crimes, like residential burglary, due to their housing density. Additionally, the 
            history of each neighborhoodâ€”factors such as redlining and gentrificationâ€”can deeply 
            influence current crime statistics and must be taken into account to fully understand 
            the complexities of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our analysis indicates that Roxbury, South End, and Dorchester have the highest rates 
            of the specified crime types in Boston. While these findings are significant, it's 
            essential to note that other neighborhoods might have higher instances of crimes not 
            directly related to personal safety or housing concerns, which weren't included in our 
            specified crime types.


        </p>

        <p>This project provides preliminary insights and should be considered as one of many tools 
            for evaluating neighborhood safety. Future residents should weigh these findings alongside 
            other factors, such as community resources, neighborhood cohesion, and future development plans, 
            when making decisions about where to live. Our research serves as a starting point for 
            understanding crime distribution across Boston, and we encourage a holistic approach when 
            considering personal and community safety.
